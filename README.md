## How to run "The Rise of Michael" .
- The app is completely built on `flutter` framework of `dart` and that's why we need `flutter sdk` and much more do your flutter setup by going to the folloewing link
- https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows
-  , after the successful of setup installation, clone the repository into your local system using below command:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/MugheesMb/The-Rise-of-Michael.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd 

# Open project in VS code
$ code .

# Install dependencies by going to pubspec.yaml
$ flutter pub get

# Run the project
$ flutter run

```


## üí° Inspiration
Ah, the 80s. We constantly look back on the era, its charming tackiness, its pointless, embarrassing, adorable fads, and its foolish sense of materialism. Spearheading this movement was the King of Pop, Michael Jackson. His reputation faltered over the years, but no one can deny that he was one of the greatest entertainers to ever walk this earth. By the late 80s, Jackson had been integrated into entertainment. One of his most significant projects was Moonwalker, a 90-minute movie that was essentially several music videos connected through a very loose plot.

## ‚öôÔ∏è What it does
It's a Michael Jackson game based on the 80s style we are trying to connect the 80s project with 20's Style Theme. We used the ray-casting method to implement the game. We used self-designed assets for the game. When you start the game you see the Landing page where you can play the game and dance with Michael other than that you can also read more about the history of Michael from the beginning. If you connect to the server and that will help you put your score on the screen.

## üõ†Ô∏è How we built it
- For Frontend and Graphics we use Canva, Figma, and other designing tools. 
- We built this game using the Flutter, dart, and Flame Engine. It is our first try with Flame engine and it 
  was worth it to try it out, even though it wasn't easy to use it. but we were all really interested in 
  learning - so this weekend, we committed to it!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges we ran into
- As It was also difficult to find the right assets for our game. So we design it all us, it was the first time we work on designing 2-D artists and other things like Landing pages, etc. Since for a Coder, it is difficult but still we will be able to do it.
- Since only one of us was familiar with the Flame Engine programming, it was a pretty steep learning curve. It was difficult to make the background of our game animated, we also find difficulty in removing the enemy whenever sound power collided with them. 

## üë©‚Äçüíºüßë‚Äçüíª Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We are proud to make this project functional and working to help gamers and fans of Michael Jackson 
  in a certain manner.
- We are immensely proud of achieving a good team contribution with each of the members who have n 
  contributed to the project in some way or another.
- We're very pleased with the end result.

## ‚öì What we learned
- We learned that it can be frustrating at times to try to learn an entirely new language and software as a team. But it was also, really, really fun, the most important things are to remember we're all in this together, and to never give up. Some bugs take a lot of time to fix but we just gotta try and try until we succeed. we gotta put in our 100%, at the end of the day it doesn't matter if we lose or win, what matter is did we give our best.


## ü§ù What's next for The Rise of Michael
- We want to have a live leaderboard, game levels, more animated aliens, game sound, and optimize our game as much as possible.
- Publish on Play Store.
- Send updates over the Phone with Twilio.
